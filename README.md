# Reinforcement Learning

Implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms in **Python & PyTorch**. The repository is structured for modularity, and reuse.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure


### Module Functions

- **`chapters/`**  
  Contains per-chapter code, demos, and notebooks. Used to show algorithm behavior in a learning-oriented way.

- **`algos/`**  
  Core algorithm implementations, grouped by family:  
  - `bandits/` â€“ multi-armed bandits (Îµ-greedy, UCB, Thompson).  
  - `tabular/` â€“ DP, MC, TD, SARSA, Q-learning.  
  - `value_based/` â€“ DQN and extensions.  
  - `policy_gradient/` â€“ REINFORCE, A2C, PPO.  
  - `actor_critic/` â€“ DDPG, TD3, SAC.

- **`common/`**  
  Reusable utilities:  
  - `nets.py` â€“ neural network architectures.  
  - `buffers.py` â€“ replay buffers (basic, prioritized, n-step, GAE).  
  - `schedules.py` â€“ epsilon, learning rate, entropy schedules.  
  - `wrappers.py` â€“ environment wrappers.  
  - `logging.py` â€“ logging and monitoring helpers.  
  - `utils.py` â€“ seeds, device helpers, serialization.

- **`envs/`**  
  Toy MDPs (e.g., Random Walk, Gridworld) and custom environments.  

- **`experiments/`**  
  Experiment configurations (YAML/JSON) for reproducibility.  

- **`scripts/`**  
  CLI entry points for training, evaluation, and plotting results.  

- **`tests/`**  
  Unit and integration tests for correctness (e.g., verifying Bellman backups, loss convergence).
